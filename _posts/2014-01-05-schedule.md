## Detailed Schedule
Homework will be assigned on a rolling basis, dependent upon how much we cover in class. I will write the homework assignment due the following class on the board at the end of any given class and update the course website with the assignment as we go.

Each entry below lists the topic of discussion for that day in class. You should read the chapter that will be discussed on any given day in advance of the class meeting. E.g., by the time class meets on Friday, January 25, you should have already read through Chapter 17.
