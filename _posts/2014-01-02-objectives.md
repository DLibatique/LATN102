## Course Objectives
This course is the second semester of a year-long introduction to the Latin language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Rome. Basic familiarity with Latin and the topics introduced in LATN 101 (Introduction to Latin 1) is required. This course will build upon the basics of the Latin language introduced in the first semester (e.g.,¹ declension, conjugation, complex sentence structure, etc.) and eventually build towards a strong command of Latin vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Latin is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Roman texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom instruction and examples in our textbook and workbook, will set a foundation for reading parts of Book 2 of Vergil’s *Aeneid*, the masterpiece of Roman literature, in the final months of the semester.

¹ **FUN FACT #1:** “e.g.” stands for *exemplī gratiā*, or “for the sake of an example”!
